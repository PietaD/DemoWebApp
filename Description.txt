Hello,



This website project is about ERP and have some features in Carrer tab. ...and still needs some work.



Project contains: ASP.NET MVC, C#, Bootstrap, RazorSyntax, EntityFramework with CodeFirst approach, full CRUD operations,
		  HTML and CSS.

CRUD operations can be found in -> carrer (dropdown menu) -> actual offers (from dropdown carrer).

In future I will add an APPLY feature (in modal) and "store" forms with appropriate offer.

Best Regards,

Daniel
